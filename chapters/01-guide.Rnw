\subsection*{Why Learn \LaTeX?}

In the past, I used \LaTeX to make publication quality text. In fact, many prefer writing in \LaTeX because they can focus on the text and avoid worrying about formatting. However, it is NOT WYSIWYG (``what you see is what you get'') word processor. In reality, the processing or compiling is a separate step. 

Nevertheless, the quality of the output and ability to integrate with R (or Python) allows us to have an exceptional tool to make reproducible documents. 

\subsection*{How to Learn \LaTeX?}

There are several ways to learn \LaTeX. I suggest you find a decent tutorial to get the basics. For example, here are some suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}{Learning \LaTeX in 30 minutes}
\end{itemize}

If you are like me and can't remember commands very well, then here's a \href{https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet-0.png}{cheet sheet} that might be helpful. 

\subsubsection{R Chunks}

To create effective graphics, each chapter will have a rchunk that creates a graphic for the chapter. To review and learn R, here are some resources:

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Noting Your Contribution}

Because this is an ongoing project, you should record your contribution to each chapter -- but also let go of these contributions at some point; Others might revise and their authorship might take some precedence, so you should both invest in the product but also be willing to detach from the final outcome as others contribute. This will feel uncomfortable at times, but please note from the beginning this is a social process and as such subject to negotiation. Please be generous to the authors that laid the foundation and be respectful of those that follow. 

\section{Setting Up Book Project--Type Setting w/ \LaTeX}

\subsection*{Latex Book Class}

Currently, the text is written using the standard book class. %However, in 2019, I (Los Huertos) will convert the format to a Tufte book class. 

\subsection*{Structuring the Text with Nested Hierarchies}

Contributors divide their contributions into sections and subsections. This format allows a consistent approach to structuring the text and forcing themes to be organized in blocks that can be used to organize the overall text. We use section, subsection, and subsubsection to break up the topic into bite sizes. 

To accomplish this, contributors use the \verb"\section{Section}" command for major sections, and the \verb"\subsection{Subsection}" command for subsections, and a similar approach for subsubsections. 

NOTE: for each nested level, it MUST be followed by the lowest level in the section before a paragraph is started -- in contrast to what is shown above!

NOTE: We may dispense with subsubsections in the future to provide a less blocky structure, but for now they remain useful. 

\subsection*{Font Changes}

We can use various methods to alter the typeset: \emph{Emphasize}, \textbf{Bold}, \textit{Italics}, and \textsl{Slanted}. We can also typeset \textrm{Roman}, \textsf{Sans Serif}, \textsc{Small Caps}, and \texttt{Typewriter} texts.  Look online to see the commands to accomplish these changes. 

You can also apply the special, mathematics only commands $\mathbb{BLACKBOARD}$, $\mathbb{BOLD}$, $\mathcal{CALLIGRAPHIC}$, and $\mathfrak{fraktur}$. Note that blackboard bold and calligraphic are correct only when applied to uppercase letters A through Z.

You can apply the size tags -- Format menu, Font size submenu -- {\tiny tiny}, {\scriptsize scriptsize}, {\footnotesize footnotesize}, {\small small}, {\normalsize normalsize}, {\large large}, {\Large Large}, {\LARGE LARGE}, {\huge huge} and {\Huge Huge}.

You can use the \verb"\begin{quote} etc. \end{quote}" environment for typesetting short quotations. Select the text then click on Insert, Quotations, Short Quotations:

\begin{quote}
The buck stops here. \emph{Harry Truman}

Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your
country. \emph{John F Kennedy}

I am not a crook. \emph{Richard Nixon}

I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. \emph{Bill Clinton}
\end{quote}

The Quotation environment is used for quotations of more than one paragraph. Following is the beginning of description of \LaTeX from \emph{Wikipedia}:

\begin{quotation}
LaTeX (/ˈlɑːtɛx/ LAH-tekh or /ˈleɪtɛx/ LAY-tekh, often stylized as \LaTeX) is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in ``What You See Is What You Get'' word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A \TeX distribution such as \TeX Live or MiK\TeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.

LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. \LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.''
\end{quotation}

Use the Verbatim environment if you want \LaTeX\ to preserve spacing, perhaps when
including a fragment from a program such as:
\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>         // < > is used for standard libraries.
void main(void)             // ''main'' method always called first.
{
 cout << ''This is a message.'';
                            // Send to output stream.
}
\end{verbatim}
(After selecting the text click on Insert, Code Environments, Code.)


\subsection*{Mathematics and Text}

\subsubsection{Warning: Special Characters}

When you use percent and ampersand symbols, hash tags, and other non-standard ASCII characters, \LaTeX will be very uncooperative. So, do yourself a favor and make sure you understand that these are used for special typesetting functions. To use them you have to ``escape'' and use commands to get them to do what you might usually expect!  \% \# \& \`e \~n `` and '' to show a few that do not reflect the key stroke you might expect. 

\LaTeX doesn't like a range of characters or they reserved for special behavior...

For example, the \# is used for tabs in a table environment. \% is used to make comments, thus stuff behind a \% is ignored. There are lots of others, but these come up the most.

\subsubsection{Creating equations}

One of the most powerful parts of \LaTeX is how it can be used to write complex equations, with all those symbols and Greek letters! This can be done inline $y = mx + b + \epsilon$ for fairly simple equations, or set apart for more complex equations:

\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theorems, etc}
\begin{theorem}
(The Currant minimax principle.) Let $T$ be completely continuous selfadjoint operator
in a Hilbert space $H$. Let $n$ be an arbitrary integer and let $u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1}$ be
an arbitrary system of $n-1$ linearly independent elements of $H$. Denote
\begin{equation}
\max_{\substack{v\in H, v\neq
0\\(v,u_1)=0,\ldots,(v,u_n)=0}}\frac{(Tv,v)}{(v,v)}=m(u_1,\ldots, u_{n-1})
\label{eqn10}
\end{equation}
Then the $n$-th eigenvalue of $T$ is equal to the minimum of these maxima, when
minimizing over all linearly independent systems $u_1,\ldots u_{n-1}$ in $H$,
\begin{equation}
\mu_n = \min_{\substack{u_1,\ldots, u_{n-1}\in H}} m(u_1,\ldots, u_{n-1}) \label{eqn20}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
The above equations are automatically numbered as equation (\ref{eqn10}) and
(\ref{eqn20}).


\subsection{Lists Environments: Making bulletted, numbered, description lists}

We use special commands to create an itemized list.

You can create numbered, bulleted, and description lists
(Use the Itemization or Enumeration buttons, or click on the Insert menu
then chose an item from the Enumeration submenu):

\begin{enumerate}
\item List item 1

\item List item 2

\begin{enumerate}
\item A list item under a list item.

\item Just another list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Third level list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fourth and final level of list items allowed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bullet item 1

\item Bullet item 2

\begin{itemize}
\item Second level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Third level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fourth (and final) level bullet item.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Description List] Each description list item has a term followed by the
description of that term.

\item[Bunyip] Mythical beast of Australian Aboriginal legends.
\end{description}

%\subsubsection{``Child'' Rnw Contributions}

%This is a chapter that we can input into the text... you will each create a chapter without the preamble and begin and end document... that can be integrated into a single book! 

\subsection{Peer Review Commenting}

You can put your comments in square brackets and in color for things that need help. \textcolor{red}{[This section is confusing, I am not sure what commenting means.]}

\subsection{Adding Figures, etc}

\subsubsection{Using Rnw Files}

To generate R figures, we use R chunks in and Rnw file, where the text is integreated. When we compile into a PDF, the program converts the files into TeX files and then combineds them into a single pdf. 

For each chapter, we create a ``child'' document and Marc will help you create that text when you begin. 

\subsubsection{Creating a floating figure}

This is my floating figure (Figure \ref{fig:plot}).

\begin{figure}

\caption{My plot's caption is here!}
\label{fig:plot}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Using R to Create Effective Figures}

R Markdown can be a very powerful tool to integrate R code, figures and text. Making high quality figures that are both clear and aestically pleasing will be something that we need to think about it. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Axis Labels -- Labelled with clarity 
  \item Axis Text -- Size, Orientation 
  \item Captions (usually better than titles)
  \item References connecting labels to references
  \item ADA accessible (e.g. color impairment mitigation)
\end{itemize}

For example, here's code to generate a pretty good figure: 

<<updatedmaunaloa, echo=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE>>=
address <- "ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt"
download.file(address, "maunaloa", quiet = F, mode = "w", cacheOK = T)

maunaloa <- read.table("maunaloa", skip=70)
names(maunaloa) <- c("year", "month", "decimal.date", "average", "interpolated", "trend", "days")
maunaloa$average[maunaloa$average==-99.99] <- NA
maunaloa <- data.frame(year=maunaloa$year, month=maunaloa$month, decimal.date=maunaloa$decimal.date, average=maunaloa$average)
head(maunaloa)
str(maunaloa)
write.csv(maunaloa, file = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Environmental-Sciences-in-East-Asia/data/maunaloa.csv", eol = "\n", row.names = F)
@

<<analyzingdata, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE>>=
maunaloa = read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Environmental-Sciences-in-East-Asia/data/maunaloa.csv")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(mgcv)

# Split the data into training and test set
set.seed(123)
training.samples <- maunaloa$average %>%
  createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train.data  <- maunaloa[training.samples, ]
test.data <- maunaloa[-training.samples, ]
future.data = max(maunaloa$decimal.date)+1:36/12

# Build the model
model <- gam(average ~ s(decimal.date), data = maunaloa)
summary(model)
# Make predictions
predictions <- model %>% predict(test.data)
# Model performance
data.frame(
  RMSE = RMSE(predictions, test.data$average),
  R2 = R2(predictions, test.data$average)
)
@

In the case of Figure \ref(fig:maunaloa), we can a create a figure that has all of the characteristics listed above, except perhaps ADA. Creating a "alt text" for the figure is something we might want to consider. 

\begin{figure}
<<maunaloa, echo=FALSE>>=
theme_set(theme_classic())
ggplot(train.data, aes(decimal.date, average) ) + 
#  stat_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE), fullrange=T) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Carbon Dioxide (ppm)") +
  stat_smooth(method = gam, formula = y ~ s(x), color = "red") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size=14), 
          axis.title=element_text(size=14))
@
\caption{Carbon Dioxide Concentrations (Mauna Loa, HI). Source: Scripps/NOAA.}
\label{fig:co2-graphic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using Boxes}

\fbox{
\begin{minipage}[c]{.9\textwidth}
\subsection{minibox X}

Some text
\end{minipage}
}

\subsection{ Cross-References, Citations, and Glossaries}

\subsubsection{Cross-References}

We can cross-reference sections (e.g. Section~\ref{ch:critical-zone}  or figures (Figure~\ref{fig:maunaloa}) using several methods. I suggest you look at the this Rmd file to see how I did it in these examples.

You can also create links to URLs or hyperlinks, e.g. \url{http://texblog.org}. However, if these addresses change, then the link will break, so I suggest you only link to internal references.

\subsubsection{Bibliography generation}

There will be two steps to cite our sources. First, we need to add the reference to a database, or bib file. This is titled 'References.bib' and is located in the main folder in our respository. When you add information to the bib file, be sure to paste in the reference using a bibTeX format. 

Second, we'll need to place in-line citations, using \verb"\citep{knitr}", which produces \citep{knitr}, by using a key, which is knitr in this case. 

For example, you might write, ``This document was produced in RStudio using the knitr package (\citep{knitr}). Also try \verb"\citet{LosHuertos2017OverviewR}" to create use the author name as the subject: \citet{LosHuertos2017OverviewR} wrote an guide to help students learn R. 

Note: You will see these citations automatically put in alphabetic order in the Bibliography at the end of the PDF. 

%Currently, we are using the ecology.bst, but it has trouble with misc type of references, so I will changing this in 2019. 

\subsubsection{Creating glossary words}
 
\newglossaryentry{peat}{
	name=peat, 
	description={is cool.}
}

\begin{definition}
This is a definition and the word is use in an glossary, e.g. \gls{peat}. \Gls{peat} is when you want to capitalize the defined word without having to re-define a capitalized version, the only downside of case sensitivity in \LaTeX.
\end{definition}
